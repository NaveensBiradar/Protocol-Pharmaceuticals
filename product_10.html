            Dolo 250 Oral Suspension is a medicine that helps to ease pain and bring down a high body temperature (fever). In children, it treats conditions like headache, toothache, body aches, fever, and the common cold.

Dolo 250 Oral Suspension is given orally, preferably at a fixed time every day. Though this medicine can be taken with or without food, it is best given after food, as Dolo 250 Oral Suspension can irritate the inner lining of an empty stomach. The dose and duration will depend upon your child’s age, body weight, and severity of the infection, so stick to the dose, time, and way prescribed by your child’s doctor. If your child vomits within 30 minutes of taking the medicine, let the child calm down and repeat the same dose. Redosing is not recommended if your child experiences any allergic reaction within 30 minutes after taking a dose.


Do not give your child Dolo 250 Oral Suspension along with other medicines (many cold and flu medicines and other painkillers) that contain paracetamol, as this may result in overdosing and cause dangerous side effects such as hepatotoxicity (liver damage). Always check the ingredients of any other medicines before giving them to your child in combination with this medicine.


Generally, Dolo 250 Oral Suspension is well-tolerated by the children. However, temporary side effects such as indigestion, nausea, and vomiting may occur in some children. Consult your doctor in case these episodes become bothersome for your child.


Dolo 250 Oral Suspension is often considered safe and effective, but may not be suitable for everybody. Inform your doctor if your child is undergoing treatment for any blood-related disorder, is allergic to any medicinal compound, or has any birth defects, liver impairment, or kidney dysfunction. This will help your child’s doctor evaluate the dose and suitability of this medicine in a better way.

          <div class="card-body">
            Dolo 250 Oral Suspension is a common painkiller used to treat aches and pains. It works by blocking chemical messengers in the brain that tell us we have pain. It is effective in relieving pain caused by headache, migraine, nerve pain, toothache, sore throat, period (menstrual) pains, arthritis, and muscle aches. This medicine is very widely used and very rarely causes side effects if taken at the right dosage. Take it as it is prescribed to get the most benefit. Do not take more or for longer than needed as that can be dangerous. In general, you should take the lowest dose that works, for the shortest possible time. It is also the first choice of painkiller during pregnancy or breastfeeding.

          <div class="card-header bg-light fw-bold">How Dolo Oral Suspension works</div>
          <div class="card-body">
           Dolo 250 Oral Suspension works as a pain reliever (analgesic) and fever reducer (antipyretic) by blocking the production of certain chemicals in the brain called prostaglandins. These chemicals are involved in causing pain and fever, so by reducing their levels, Dolo 250 Oral Suspension helps ease pain and discomfort and lowers body temperature.

            Rabesec-D SR Capsule is a combination medicine used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (acid reflux). 
            It works by relieving the symptoms of acidity, such as heartburn, stomach pain, or irritation. 
            It also neutralizes the acid and promotes easy passage of gas to reduce stomach discomfort.
            Rabesec-D SR Capsule should be taken on an empty stomach in the dose and duration advised by your doctor. 
            The exact dose will depend on your condition and response to treatment. 
            Continue taking it for as long as prescribed, even if your symptoms improve, as stopping early may cause them to return or worsen. 
            Inform your healthcare provider about all other medicines you are taking, as some may interact with Rabesec-D SR Capsule.
            Common side effects include diarrhea, stomach pain, dry mouth, headache, flatulence, and weakness. These are usually mild and temporary. 
            However, contact your doctor immediately if any side effects persist or cause concern. 
            This medicine may cause dizziness or drowsiness, so avoid driving or activities requiring alertness until you know how it affects you.
            Refrain from drinking alcohol, as it can increase drowsiness. Lifestyle measures such as drinking cold milk and avoiding spicy foods, coffee, tea, and chocolate can enhance treatment effectiveness. 
            Before starting Rabesec-D SR Capsule, inform your doctor if you have any liver or kidney problems, or if you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding.

            In Treatment of Gastroesophageal reflux disease (Acid reflux)
            Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a chronic (long-term) condition in which there is an excess production of acid in the stomach. 
            Rabesec-D SR Capsule reduces the amount of acid your stomach makes and relieves the pain associated with heartburn and acid reflux. 
            You should take it exactly as it is prescribed for it to be effective. 
            Some simple lifestyle changes can help reduce the symptoms of GERD. 
            Think about what foods trigger heartburn and try to avoid them; eat smaller, more frequent meals; try to lose weight if you are overweight, and try to find ways to relax. 
            Do not eat within 3-4 hours of going to bed.

          <div class="card-header bg-light fw-bold">How Rabesec-D Capsule SR works</div>
          <div class="card-body">
          Rabesec-D SR Capsule is a combination of two medicines: Domperidone and Rabeprazole. Domperidone is a prokinetic which works on the upper digestive tract to increase the movement of the stomach and intestines, allowing the food to move more easily through the stomach. 
          Rabeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) which works by reducing the amount of acid in the stomach, which helps in the relief of acid-related indigestion and heartburn.

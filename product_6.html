          <div class="card-header bg-light fw-bold">How AeroFresh Tablet works</div>
          <div class="card-body">
           AeroFresh Tablet is a combination of two medicines: Levocetirizine and Montelukast, which relieve sneezing and a runny nose due to allergies. Levocetirizine is an antihistamine that blocks a chemical messenger (histamine) responsible for runny nose, watery eyes, and sneezing. Montelukast is a leukotriene antagonist. It works by blocking another chemical messenger (leukotriene). This reduces inflammation (swelling) in the airways and nose, and improves symptoms.

          <div class="card-body">
            AeroFresh Tablet is a medicine that provides relief from symptoms such as a blocked or runny nose, sneezing, and itchy or watery eyes. This will make it easier for you to go about your daily activities. It rarely has any serious side effects, and you may only need to take it on days you have symptoms. If you are taking it to prevent getting symptoms, you should use it regularly to get the most benefit.

            In Treatment of Hay fever

            Hay fever, also called allergic rhinitis, causes cold-like signs and symptoms, such as a runny nose, itchy eyes, congestion, sneezing, and sinus pressure. The only difference is that in hay fever, these symptoms are not produced due to a virus but are simply allergic responses of our body to allergens (allergy-causing agents such as pollen). AeroFresh Tablet is used to provide relief from the symptoms of hay fever. It works by blocking the release of the chemical substance responsible for producing such allergy symptoms. AeroFresh Tablet is a safe medicine that helps treat hay fever and makes us feel at ease.
